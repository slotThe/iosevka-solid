# iosevka-solid

This is my personal build of iosevka. The build files are included,
though I don't really expect anyone else to use it. It's mostly here so
installing the font with nix is just a `fetchFromGitHub` command away.

At this point, the font is *heavily* inspired by
[Protesilaos Stavrou](https://protesilaos.com/)'s
[iosevka-comfy](https://git.sr.ht/~protesilaos/iosevka-comfy) font.
The most prominent tweaked feature might be the line height. Setting
this to a bigger value does real wonders for text recognitionâ€”at least
in my case.
