# iosevka-solid

- Current target: [d63e3630](https://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka/commit/d63e3630c70831b1ba0b3568aa4e12c11d4f3d01)

This is my personal build of Iosevka.
The build files are included, though I don't really expect anyone else to use it.
It's mostly here so installing the font with nix is just a `fetchFromGitHub` command away.

At this point, the font is *heavily* inspired by
[Protesilaos Stavrou](https://protesilaos.com/)'s [iosevka-comfy](https://git.sr.ht/~protesilaos/iosevka-comfy) font.
The most prominent tweaked feature might be the line height.
Setting this to a bigger value does real wonders for text recognitionâ€”at least in my case.
