# iosevka-solid

- Current target: [bc4c4147](https://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka/commit/bc4c41478459f15495dd02a20a46a1828d0eb7da)

This is my personal build of Iosevka.
The build files are included, though I don't really expect anyone else to use it.
It's mostly here so installing the font with nix is just a `fetchFromGitHub` command away.

At this point, the font is *heavily* inspired by
[Protesilaos Stavrou](https://protesilaos.com/)'s [iosevka-comfy](https://git.sr.ht/~protesilaos/iosevka-comfy) font.
The most prominent tweaked feature might be the line height.
Setting this to a bigger value does real wonders for text recognitionâ€”at least in my case.
