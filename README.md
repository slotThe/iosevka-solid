# iosevka-solid

This is my personal build of iosevka.  The build files are included,
though I don't really expect anyone else to use it.  It's mostly here so
installing the font with nix is just a `fetchFromGitHub` command away.

The most prominent feature might be the tweaked line height.  Setting
this to a bigger value does real wonders for text recognitionâ€”at least
in my case.
